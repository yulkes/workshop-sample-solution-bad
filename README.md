# Sample Bad Solution

This Repo is a sample bad solution for the example home assignment described in [Hacking the Home Assignment](https://github.com/yulkes/PublicSpeaking/tree/master/HackingTheHomeAssignment) Workshop.


## Why is it bad?
A real bad solution though wouldn't even be in GitHub, and would definitely not have a README.md which describes it.

Why is this solution bad? Mainly, because it just works. It barely scratches the bar for passing. This is how a lot of home assignment submissions look and feel. Once all functional requirements are met, a single .py file is sent to the reviewer, and the candidate moves on with their life.

This submission could've been a lot worse though.
The code could've had missing implementations, typos, etc. . At its current state, it still looks like something someone would send. This is why my workshop exists.
